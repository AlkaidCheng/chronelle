# Implemented Architecture

Chronelle starts as a TypeScript modular monolith in a pnpm workspace. The web
and API applications deploy independently while domain contracts and database
infrastructure remain explicit shared packages.

The first product slice is event planning. Canonical `Event`, `Task`,
`Expense`, `Reminder`, and `Document` records will support event detail,
to-do, calendar, timeline, itinerary, expense, and reminder projections.

## Non-negotiable invariant

An object has one canonical identity, can appear in many contexts, has one
canonical permission scope, and every human or AI access passes through the
same authorization decision.

Views will query canonical objects and first-class relationships. They will not
own copies of business fields. Typed tables will hold stable domain data while
the common `objects` table holds identity and lifecycle fields.

## Current module boundaries

- `apps/web` owns HTTP rendering and browser interaction.
- `apps/api` owns transport, authentication-provider composition, request
  principal resolution, and personal-workspace bootstrap.
- `packages/authorization` owns the central permission policy and its
  PostgreSQL-backed access lookup.
- `packages/schemas` owns contracts shared across process boundaries.
- `packages/db` owns ordered migration execution, Drizzle query mappings,
  UUIDv7 generation, database connections, and persistence integrity tests.
- `infrastructure/migrations` owns immutable PostgreSQL schema changes.

Object-model, storage, and API-client packages will appear with the first
behavior that needs them. Each package must hide a concrete domain decision;
transport-only forwarding layers are not added in advance.

## Persistence kernel

PostgreSQL owns schema constraints through immutable SQL migrations. Drizzle
maps the accepted schema for typed queries but does not generate or execute
migrations.

Every typed domain row references one canonical object through its workspace,
object ID, and fixed object type. Composite foreign keys prevent relations,
permission scopes, and grants from joining resources across workspaces.
Relationships never cascade-delete their endpoint objects. Audit events are
append-only at the database boundary.

The application generates UUIDv7 identifiers before persistence. This keeps
IDs sortable without relying on database-version-specific UUID functions.

## Runtime boundaries

The Fastify API resolves each bearer credential through an `AuthProvider`, then
maps the resulting external identity to a Chronelle user and active workspace.
The development adapter issues random opaque tokens, stores only token digests,
and is registered only when explicitly enabled. A production adapter can
replace it without changing workspace or authorization services.

The first sign-in transaction creates one user, one personal workspace, one
owner membership, and one audit event. A unique personal-owner constraint makes
this idempotent under concurrent requests.

`AuthorizationService.can(principal, action, resource)` is the only object
permission decision. It considers workspace membership, a direct grant, and
the resource's one canonical permission scope. It ignores relationships,
expired grants, and deleted resources. Workspace selection uses the same store
to require membership or an active grant.

Application mutations use `runAuditedMutation`, which appends one audit event
inside the same database transaction. An invalid audit record therefore rolls
back the business change. Later object services will add validation,
authorization, and expected-version checks before entering this boundary.

React components do not contain authorization or domain business logic.

PostgreSQL is the canonical data store. Object files will be accessed through a
storage interface and stored outside PostgreSQL. Provider adapters will keep
CloudBase identity and Tencent COS concerns out of the domain layer.
